Hello there! This is another mini project of mine. It is all about the Fibonacci numbers

I wish I could create this project on the 11/23/5813 but I just couldn't wait so long. Much like the Fibonacci was occupied with his rabbits, I was thinking about a certain number of the first human beings that had to born at the dawn of our civilization. I guess we didn't technically start from 0, but I just cannot help thinking that the current population of the Earth (ca. 7,50 billion people) is a very large Fibonacci number. Can this really be?

The current programm has 3 features:
1) Calculating the first n Fibonacc numbers using the iteration and
2) recursion
3) Calculating the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers

Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
